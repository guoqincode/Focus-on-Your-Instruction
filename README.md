# Focus-on-Your-Instruction (CVPR2024)
This repository contains the official implementation of the paper [Focus on Your Instruction: Fine-grained and Multi-instruction Image Editing by Attention Modulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.10113).



## ToDo
- [ ] **Release Inference Code.**
- [ ] **Release inference code that combines grounding-sam (more accurate segmentation, but potentially slower, and at the same time, grounding-sam has no reasoning ability).**
